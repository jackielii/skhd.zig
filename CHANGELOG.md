## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.13] - 2025-08-27

### Added
- **Support for backtick (`) special character** - Added backtick to the list of recognized special characters in the tokenizer
  - Enables hotkey bindings with the backtick key
  - Thanks to @danielfalbo for the contribution (#8)

### Fixed
- **Duplicate keycode from layout** - Fixed issue where keycodes could be duplicated when retrieved from keyboard layout
- **ZBench vendor dependency** - Fixed vendor import for zbench benchmarking library

### Changed
- **Improved error messages** - Enhanced parser error reporting with contextual information
  - Added helpful error messages for invalid hex keycodes with examples
  - Improved duplicate command detection with specific context about conflicts
  - Added suggestions for common mistakes (e.g., "Did you forget to declare it with '::mode'?")
  - Better error reporting for file loading, blacklist, and shell configuration failures
- **Duplicate command handling** - Allow identical duplicate commands in process groups
  - This enables more flexible configuration with overlapping process groups
  - Duplicate detection still prevents conflicting commands for the same process
- **Build optimization** - Only build all targets on main branch to speed up development builds
- **Code improvements** - Various internal refactoring and simplifications
  - Simplified activation equality check
  - Use Zig field syntax for cleaner code
  - Added error sets for type safety in Hotkey methods

## [0.0.12] - 2025-07-15

### Added
- **Mode activation with optional command execution** - Enhanced mode switching with command execution support
  - New syntax: `keysym ; mode : command` executes command when switching to mode
  - Process-specific mode activation in process lists (e.g., `"terminal" ; vim_mode`)
  - Process group mode activation (e.g., `@browsers ; browser_mode`)
  - Comprehensive test coverage for all activation scenarios
- Added `activation` variant to `ProcessCommand` enum for proper mode activation tracking

### Changed
- Refactored command parsing to eliminate code duplication with helper function `parse_command`
- Removed redundant `flags.activate` field from `ModifierFlag` 
- Updated SYNTAX.md and README.md with comprehensive mode activation documentation

### Fixed
- Fixed mode activation implementation to use dedicated enum variant instead of borrowing command enum
- Improved error handling for empty commands followed by references

## [0.0.11] - 2025-07-13

### Changed
- Optimized command execution by using null-terminated strings throughout, eliminating runtime allocations in exec.zig
- Refactored Hotkey API to have separate methods for each action type (add_process_command, add_process_forward, add_process_unbound)

### Fixed
- Fixed benchmark to use new Hotkey API methods

## [0.0.10] - 2025-07-08

### Fixed
- **Critical bug fix**: Capture mode now respects passthrough and unbound actions
  - Previously, capture mode would consume all keys including those explicitly marked as passthrough (`->`) or unbound (`~`)
  - Now these keys are properly passed through to applications even in capture mode

### Added
- Support for unbound action syntax: `<keysym> ~`
  - Keys marked as unbound are not captured and pass through to applications
  - Compatible with all existing features (modes, process lists, etc.)
- Added `--message` flag to release script for custom tag messages

### Changed
- Refactored hotkey processing to use `HotkeyResult` enum instead of boolean return
  - Clearer distinction between consumed, passthrough, and not_found states
  - Eliminated code duplication between `handleKeyDown` and `handleSystemKey`

### Internal
- Added comprehensive tests for capture mode behavior with passthrough and unbound actions
- Extracted common hotkey result handling into `handleHotkeyResult` helper function
- Updated SYNTAX.md documentation to include unbound action syntax

## [0.0.9] - 2025-07-07

### Fixed

- A subtle but critical bug only happens in release mode due to how memory allocation works with aggressive allocators like `smp_allocator` or `c_allocator`. This bug caused HashMaps to silently point to different objects after destroying an object that was still referenced in the map. This has been fixed by using a array list to track the hotkeys instead of a HashMap, which avoids this issue entirely.

### Added
- Improved duplicate hotkey detection with better error reporting

### Internal
- Added issue template for better bug reporting
- Updated CI workflow configuration
- Include build mode in version string output

## [0.0.8] - 2025-07-06

### Changed
- **Major performance improvement**: Achieved allocation-free event loop
  - Replaced dynamic allocation for process names with fixed-size buffer
  - Zero allocations during runtime after initialization
  - Event loop is now completely allocation-free in release builds
- Refactored hotkey implementation for simplicity and performance
  - Removed HotkeyArrayHashMap and HotkeyMultiArrayList (740+ lines removed)
  - Consolidated hotkey functionality in Hotkey.zig
- Enhanced test coverage with comprehensive duplicate detection tests
- CarbonEvent now uses a pre-allocated buffer for process names to avoid runtime allocations
- Moved VERSION file from src/VERSION to root directory for better visibility
- Code cleanup and formatting improvements across multiple modules

### Fixed
- Fixed cleanup logic when sending SIGINT to the process
- Fixed memory leaks in Hotkey.zig and improved memory management
- **Duplicate definition detection**: Now reports errors instead of silently overwriting duplicate entries in config
- Fixed CI/CD release workflow by replacing deprecated upload-release-asset action with gh CLI

### Internal
- Added TrackingAllocator for monitoring memory allocations during development
- Created new exec.zig module for command execution
- Improved error handling in Parser, Mappings, and Keycodes modules

## [0.0.7] - 2025-07-05

### Fixed
- **Accessibility permission check reliability** - Replaced unreliable event tap creation with `AXIsProcessTrusted()` API
- `--status` command now correctly reports accessibility permission state
- Fixed issue where permissions showed as "not granted" even when properly configured

### Changed
- Permission checking now uses the official macOS API for more accurate results

## [0.0.6] - 2025-07-04

### Added
- **Command definitions feature** with `.define` directive for reusable command templates
  - Support for placeholders (`{{1}}`, `{{2}}`, etc.) in command templates
  - Reference commands with `@command_name("arg1", "arg2")` syntax
  - Reduces configuration duplication and improves maintainability
- Enhanced error handling for command definition parsing with clear error messages

### Changed
- Refactored tokenizer to clean up token text representation
- Optimized command definition storage by moving it directly to Parser
- Updated documentation to include command definition examples

### Fixed

- Benchmark suite using zBench for hot path optimization
- Carbon event handler for efficient app switching notifications

### Changed
- **Major performance optimization**: Cache process name lookups (25μs → 21ns)
- **Eliminated double hotkey lookup**: Combined into single `processHotkey` function (169ns → 83ns)
- CPU usage reduced from ~1.2% to ~0.5% (matching original skhd)

### Fixed
- High CPU usage compared to original skhd implementation
- Unnecessary system calls in hot path

- Removed unnecessary stdout/stderr syncing in logger for better performance

### Fixed
- Service management commands now provide better error messages and guidance
- Homebrew service integration now works more reliably with proper binary path updates

## [0.0.2] - 2025-07-01
